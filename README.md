## âœ¨ Key Features & Technical Skills

This project highlights my expertise in modern front-end technologies to create dynamic and immersive web experiences.

* **UI/UX & Animations:** Created a 3D parallax hero section with an interactive HTML5 Canvas particle system, scroll-based animations using `IntersectionObserver`, complex CSS keyframe animations, and engaging micro-interactions like magnetic buttons and sound effects on hover.
* **Front-End Development:** Built with semantic HTML5, advanced CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties), and dynamic JavaScript (ES6+ & jQuery) for DOM manipulation and event handling.
* **Third-Party Libraries:** Integrated `jQuery` for simplified scripting and `Tone.js` for web audio effects.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

This is a high-fidelity showcase of the interactive front-end components I developed for the AUM Foundation's website. The goal was to create a visually stunning user experience that reflects the organization's spiritual mission.

**Please Note:** Due to client confidentiality, this repository contains only the front-end code snippets for the components I personally built. It does not represent the full website or its backend. The development was executed within a WordPress environment, demonstrating my ability to build custom solutions within existing frameworks.
